            </div>
            <p>English mathematician and computer scientist. He graduated from King's College at Cambridge University
              and taught at the
              same university. He is considered the father of computer science and the founder of modern computer
              science. When World
              War II broke out, he took charge of the Nazi German Enigma code-breaking at the request of the government
              to contribute
              to the victory of the Allied Powers, shortening the duration of the World War and saving approximately 14
              million
              people.</p>
            <p> After the end of the war, he returned to the private sector, but in 1952, he was arrested on charges of
              homosexuality,
              which was treated illegally in Britain at the time, and was found dead at his home two years later in
              1954. The cause of
              death was cyanide poisoning, and it was presumed to be suicide, but the bereaved family and some
              historians insisted on
              the accident.</p>
            <p>Since then, as LGBTQ human rights have surfaced and misconceptions have begun to change, talk of amnesty
              for Turing
              began to emerge. On December 24, 2013, Queen Elizabeth II was granted special pardons by the authority of
              the monarch at
              the request of the Minister of Justice, and was completely reinstated when the acquittal was declared
              unconstitutional
              in a legal provision that entwined him under the pretext of his sexual orientation. It was 59 years after
              his death.</p>

              <hr />
              <p>When he was a child, he boasted a clear brain by learning to read in three weeks and solving
                calculus-deepening problems
                on his own without learning calculus from someone. At the age of 16, his school math teacher told
                Turing's mother,
              <p style="font-style: oblique;">"There's nothing more to teach, so study on your own."</p>

              </div>
              <P>At the age of 16, he met his first love, a friend named Christopher Morcom, and was greatly influenced.
                Morcom was also
                a gifted student who had been said to have entered Cambridge University as a scholarship student if she
                had not died
                early, and they both liked to solve difficult math problems together. However, when Morcombe died of
                mycobacterium
                bacteremia in 1930, he devised a computational theory while thinking about how to store the intelligence
                that's in
                Morcombe's brain or deliver it to others.</P>

              <h3>2-2. youth</h3>
              <hr />
              <p>Turing passed the first entrance examination at Cambridge University, a prestigious university in
                England. However,
                because he couldn't get a scholarship, Turing retake the examination and enter as a scholarship student.
                While attending
                King's College at Cambridge University, he has already published a groundbreaking paper called On
                Computable Numbers,
                with an Application to the Entscheidung problem (1936). This is famous for presenting the theoretical
                basis for Turing
                machine theory and Neumann computers.</p>
              <p>The Turing machine is a concept about the feasibility of computers and was first used in the study of
                the possibility of
                proving propositions. Like Russell's paradox and incompleteness theorem, Turing proved the proposition
                'I cannot be
                proved by finite number of logical processes'. In the middle, Turing proves that if there is a long
                strip of paper
                divided into compartments and the ability to set the result of reading and replacing data on it, it is
                the same as
                mathematical proof and human intelligence.</p>
              <p>Turing went to the United States to study after completing his master's degree in mathematics at
                Cambridge University,
                where he earned his doctorate in mathematics at Princeton University. At this time, he became acquainted
                with Turing
                Chochurch and John von Neumann of mathematical logic, both of whom were professors at Princeton.
                Neumann, who was 9
                years older than Turing, interacted with him and noticed his talent, and while he was also aware of
                Turing's sexual
                orientation, he remained close. Neumann advised Turing to stay in the United States rather than return
                to England, where
                homosexuality is classified as a crime, when Turing's doctoral degree was completed. Neumann offered
                Turing his teaching
                position, but Turing, a young man who was full of patriotism at the time, refused it and chose to return
                to England with
                his devotion to his country.</p>

              <hr />
              <p>After returning home, Turing joined the British decryption agency GC&CS in 1939 and was in charge of
                Session Hut 8 to
                decrypt the Nazi German army. During his transfer as the director, he developed Turing Bombe, and it was
                at this point
                that he decrypted the infamous Enigma. Of course, he traveled from GC&CS to the United States, where he
                developed a
                relationship with Claude Shannon.</p>

              <h3>2-4. After World War II</h3>
              <hr />
              <p>After the end of the war, Turing participated in the development of the Manchester Mark 1, an early
                digital computer at
                the University of Manchester, and published a paper on the structure of a program-embedded computer, the
                first von
                Neumann computer in the UK.</p>
              <p>In 1950, he published a paper on artificial intelligence called "Computing Machinery and Intelligence
                Computing
                Machinery and Intelligence". It is famous for devising artificial intelligence even before the word
                artificial
                intelligence was coined and predicting its widespread use. In the paper, Allen proposes an artificial
                intelligence
                experiment called the Turing test. The paper, which was contributed to the renowned philosophical
                journal Mind, combined
                with the concept of the Turing machine, became the beginning of the 'functionalism' trend in modern
                psychological
                philosophy. As an objection to this, the argument of the 'Chinese Room' presented by American
                philosopher John Seol in
                1980 is famous.</p>

              <h3> 2-5</h3>
              <hr />
              <p>Unlike Turing's accomplishments and extraordinary abilities, his later years were not good. Having
                returned to his
                academic career after a war, Turing met and dated a man named Arnold Murray by chance. Then one day, it
                turns out that
                Allen's house was stolen and that Arnold was involved in the incident. Feeling betrayed significantly,
                Turing called the
                police and told fellow scientists that he was gay, just as he went around telling them that he was gay,
                Turing also told
                the police about his relationship with Arnold. However, homosexuality was illegal in England at the time
                in 1952, and
                Turing was charged with obscenity.</p>
              <p>Because it was a job, Turing was treated with no discrimination by his colleagues who valued ability
                and humanity rather
                than his sexual orientation. Regardless of Turing's achievements and usual behavior, under the British
                anti-gay law at
                the time, Alan Turing was clearly branded a social disturbing criminal and was treated as an
                unscrupulous villain by the
                public and the judiciary. The McCarthyism craze that was prevalent in Western capitalist countries at
                the time even led
                to a sad false accusation that he might be a spy on the Soviet side.</p>
              <p>Turing enjoyed playing chess, and the conspiracy theory was convinced when Turing's chess partner was
                identified as a
                major Soviet spy. As a result, the British intelligence department monitored his daily routine because
                of his background
                as a first-class computer scientist, and this tragedy overlapped and Turing's social status fell to the
                abyss.
                Eventually, a court ruled against homosexuality and required him to choose either imprisonment or
                chemical castration by
                female hormone administration. Turing, a scholar to the bone, refused imprisonment and chose castration
                to continue his
                research.</p>
              <p>However, things changed when Turing was convicted. At the time, homosexuality was considered a security
                risk, so Turing
                was excluded from all confidential duties and even restricted from leaving the country.</p>
              <p>Eventually, Turing decided to commit suicide at the young age of 41 in 1954. There was no will. There
                is a myth that
                Turing died after taking a bite of an apple injected with cyanide, which is difficult to be true. There
                was a
                half-cracked apple at the actual death site, but sharing it half-cracked was Allen's usual habit, and
                there is no clear
                evidence that cyanide was injected into the apple.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then, in the 2000s, along with the movement to promote LGBTQ human rights, a petition for an apology to
                Turing began,
                and Britain's unfair punishment in the past came to the surface again. In 2009, when the Labor Party
                came to power,
                Prime Minister Gordon Brown formally apologized for the unfair treatment Turing received. The UK Post
                Office included
                Alan Turing among the '10 Great Britons' to be placed on the stamp to be issued in February 2012.
                Although he was a
                criminal under written law, he changed his perception of LGBTQ people and regained his honor in half a
                century by
                putting more weight on his great achievements.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, there was also a campaign to make 2012 the year of Turing, the 100th anniversary of
                its birth.
                However, the British House of Representatives properly poured cold water on this move, and the national
                apology and
                pardon resolution for Alan Turing proposed to the British House of Representatives on February 6 was
                rejected. David
                Cameron, the Conservative-centered cabinet, interpreted that he was refusing a pardon for Turing out of
                fear that it
                would be seen as acceptance of homosexuality.</p>
              <p>On 23 December 2013, Turing was officially reinstated by the Queen's special pardon after a Turing
                reinstatement
                petition was filed by Stephen Hawking and tens of thousands of other literate people.
                It was 59 years after his death</p>
