              <h2>overview</h2>
              <hr/>
              <p>English mathematician and computer scientist. He graduated from King's College at Cambridge University and taught at the
              same university. He is considered the father of computer science and the founder of modern computer science. When World
              War II broke out, he took charge of the Nazi German Enigma code-breaking at the request of the government to contribute
              to the victory of the Allied Powers, shortening the duration of the World War and saving approximately 14 million
              people.</p>
              <p> After the end of the war, he returned to the private sector, but in 1952, he was arrested on charges of homosexuality,
              which was treated illegally in Britain at the time, and was found dead at his home two years later in 1954. The cause of
              death was cyanide poisoning, and it was presumed to be suicide, but the bereaved family and some historians insisted on
              the accident.</p>
              <p>Since then, as LGBTQ human rights have surfaced and misconceptions have begun to change, talk of amnesty for Turing
              began to emerge. On December 24, 2013, Queen Elizabeth II was granted special pardons by the authority of the monarch at
              the request of the Minister of Justice, and was completely reinstated when the acquittal was declared unconstitutional
              in a legal provision that entwined him under the pretext of his sexual orientation. It was 59 years after his death.</p>

              <h2>in life</h2>
              <hr/>
              <p>When he was a child, he boasted a clear brain by learning to read in three weeks and solving calculus-deepening problems
              on his own without learning calculus from someone. At the age of 16, his school math teacher told Turing's mother,
              <p style="font-style: oblique;">"There's nothing more to teach, so study on your own."</p></p>
              <P>At the age of 16, he met his first love, a friend named Christopher Morcom, and was greatly influenced. Morcom was also
              a gifted student who had been said to have entered Cambridge University as a scholarship student if she had not died
              early, and they both liked to solve difficult math problems together. However, when Morcombe died of mycobacterium
              bacteremia in 1930, he devised a computational theory while thinking about how to store the intelligence that's in
              Morcombe's brain or deliver it to others.</P>
